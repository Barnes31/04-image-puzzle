# 04-image-puzzle

This is the fourth programming assignment for ILS-Z399: a sliding-puzzle game. The requirements for this assignment were as follows:

* Write a Python program for playing a simple "sliding puzzle" game
* A popular variant of the sliding puzzle game is the [15 Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). That would be a good place to start
* Using pygame, draw a window and graphics inside the window
* Capture mouse or keyboard events (or both) to enable user interaction
* Report a winning condition if the player completes the puzzle
* Extra credit will be awarded if the puzzle is an image rather than colored shapes (but get the shapes working first!)
* You can assume that the user will have pygame installed on their system

I hope you enjoy playing the game. It was a fun exercise.
